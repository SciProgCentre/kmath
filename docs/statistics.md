# Statistics

Mathematically speaking, a statistic is a measurable numerical function of sample data.
In KMath, a statistic is a function that operates on a [Buffer](buffers.md) and is implemented as the `evaluate` method
of the `Statistic` interface.
There are two subinterfaces of the `Statistic` interface:

* `BlockingStatistic` – A statistic that is computed in a synchronous blocking mode
* `ComposableStatistic` – A statistic tha could be computed separately on different blocks of data and then composed
